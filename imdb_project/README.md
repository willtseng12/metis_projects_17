## **Overview**

This is my second project at Metis data science bootcamp. This project utilizes web scraping and linear regression methods to acquire publicly available data on the web to predict movie, and to create a predictive model on a movie's gross profit based off of input features deemed relevant available on the web.

## **Data Source**

Around 11 years of movie data (2007-2017) on IMDB avaialble to scrape from [here](http://www.imdb.com/search/title?sort=boxoffice_gross_us&title_type=feature&year=2007,2017).

## **Goal**

To discover whether there were strong early indicators of a movie's success as indicated by its eventual gross profit and their relative predicitive strength as outputed by the regression model.

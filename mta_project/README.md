This is my first project at Metis data science bootcamp. This is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) 
project with the goal of finding relevant insights from messy data to make helpful business recommendations.

## **Back Story**

```
An email from a potential client:

Krishna & Julia -

It was great to meet with you and chat at the event where we recently met and had a nice chat. 
We’d love to take some next steps to see if working together is something that would make 
sense for both parties.

As we mentioned, we are interested in harnessing the power of data and analytics to optimize the 
effectiveness of our street team work, which is a significant portion of our fundraising efforts.

WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) has an annual gala at the beginning of the summer each year. As we are 
new and inclusive organization, we try to do double duty with the gala both to fill our event 
space with individuals passionate about increasing the participation of women in technology, 
and to concurrently build awareness and reach.

To this end we place street teams at entrances to subway stations. The street teams collect 
email addresses and those who sign up are sent free tickets to our gala.

Where we’d like to solicit your engagement is to use MTA subway data, which as I’m sure you know 
is available freely from the city, to help us optimize the placement of our street teams, such 
that we can gather the most signatures, ideally from those who will attend the gala and 
contribute to our cause.

The ball is in your court now—do you think this is something that would be feasible for your group? 
From there we can explore what kind of an engagement would make sense for all of us.

Best,

Karrine and Dahlia

WTWY International

#### **Data source**:
MTA turnstile data available [here](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html)  
  
#### **Goal**:
The goal is to come up with a list of stations and strategies that will best help WTWY optimize 
their street canvas team's exposure to both individuals who cares about WTWY's cause and will
likely participate in the upcoming gala and contribute (donations, etc.) to their cause.

#### **Approach**:

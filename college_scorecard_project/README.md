## **Overview**

This is my final project at Metis data science bootcamp. In this project, I explored the the college scorecard dataset 
provided by the US Department of Education by trying to predict the mean earnings 10 years after entry.

It was also an opportunity to further practice handling messy data with lots of missing and provacy suppressed values.

Aside, from the cleaning and predicitive modeling aspect of the project, I also spent a decent amount of effort trying to interpret the result of my predictive model by justifying or 'un-justifying' certain ways to go about understanding variable importance and effect interpretation.

## **Data Source**

The dataset on the 2011 - 2012 school year. It is the least sparse dataset among the ones provided.

## **Goal**

The initial motivation and goal for this project was to modify some of the method and approach to predictive modeling 
from the study linked below:

The goal was to see how predicitive of a model I can still construct having revised some of the statistical method leveraged
to handle privacy suppressed values in the paper above. Furthermore, one of the goal was to use more powerful predicitive model
not explored by the paper to see how well we can predict earnings while keeping a good degree of interpretability in result

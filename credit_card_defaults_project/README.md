## **Overview**

This is my third project at Metis data science bootcamp. This project aims to further increase my exposure to feature selection
and engineering. Furthermore, it also required the implementation of classifier algorithms to predict credit card loan defaults.

## **Data Source**

6 months (from April 2005 to September 2005) of credit card payment status, amount, history along with basic account information 
of 30,000 Taiwanese credit card client of a commercial bank. The data is available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
[here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients).

## **Goal**

To predict whether a person is goign to default on his or her credit card loan on October 2005 given the previous 6 months credit card payment information and basic account info.
